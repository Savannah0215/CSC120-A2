It was a little overwhelming to look at procedural_resale_shop.py, even though I didn't need to modify any code in this file, because it contained so many functions that I'd need to understand to create my own code in oo_resale_shop.py. It helped to cross-check what the lecture slides said about methods and attributes, as well as the example OneCard.py file we worked on in class, in order to know what I should do for computer.py and oo_resale_shop.py.
